	<div class="journalentry"> ALWAYS BE PREPARED. After a full day of hiking in the sun (in which I climbed 180 floors according to my iPhone), I found myself seated on the last bus back to my hostel in Sorrento next to an American woman fanning herself and complaining of nausea on the windy coastal roads. I carry bags with me everywhere, along with silverware, napkins, pens, and hair ties, since they're ALWAYS useful. All those items have made my life easier at one point or another, but I think this incidence tops the list of moments I was most glad to be prepared. About two minutes after I lent this woman a bag, she pitched over and hurled her whole stomach into it right next to me on this packed bus. Through a pounding headache and heavy revulsion I managed to smile politely and graciously accept her repeated thanks and subsequent attempts at small talk. </div>
