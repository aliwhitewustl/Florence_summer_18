	<div class="journalentry"> I don't think I'll ever forget the man who stopped me in the cookie aisle to ask me where I was from. “Sei Italiana?” When I responded that I wasn’t Italian, but American, he replied in strained English that he knew, he could tell, he knew from the second I passed him. “Italian people never smile like that,” he said. I became aware of how much I make eye contact with strangers and smile at them and how some people have seemed to be legitimately surprised by this. Is friendliness something to be proud of? Or am I just being strange here? I was uncertain if the man’s comment was praise or mild warning, like he was gently letting me know of a faux pas. I’ve continued to smile at people here, and they smile back. It’s already obvious I’m not from here, and I think friendliness is a small way to feel connected to strangers and society as a whole.   </div>
