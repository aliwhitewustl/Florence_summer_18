	<div class="journalentry">After the purchase of both the slice of cheesecake AND the apple strudel did not go at all as planned, I decided to pick up some reliable Lindt truffles. There was a store right next to the palace gardens I aimed to visit. However, instead of redeeming myself from the poor purchases, I just felt low-energy for eating too much sugar. During my exploration of the gardens I saw a dude walking with his headphones on looking intense as hell and I had a moment of so powerfully wishing I were the type of person who could go up to him, tap him on the shoulder and ask what he was listening to. He looked like he was about to face his nemesis or avenge someone’s death. He positioned himself right at the center of the most grand view and I started walking in that direction, hoping that by the time I got there I would have summoned the courage to make eye contact with him and motion for him to move his headphones aside. Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, he moved on before I reached him. I’m always at war with my comfort zone, and this time fate decided the battle for me. </div>
