	<div class="journalentry"> Scribbling this down very quickly to remember this moment forever. I’m on an outcropping along the Path of the Gods on the Amalfi Coast. This is so beautiful. The solitude is so full and round and smooth. People are down below – but I’m up here. My toes are sore and covered in dirt. Geckos slip across rocks. Insects twitter in the brush around. The golden hour is fading but this moment is so perfect and beautiful and just what I wanted my life to be like. Everything below is so still from far away. I know my cell phone camera could never capture what I’m witnessing as the sun sets behind one of the hills across the way. No hike I take will compare to this one for a long, long time. I wish I could capture it and return to right now whenever I wanted. </div>

	<div class="journalentry"> Life abides in these public parks in a way I’ve never seen in the suburbs. Having a space just to see other people and feel liveliness is so important for mental health. I can’t think of a single space like this where I live that’s outside and accessible to everyone, even people without cars. Where I come from, there’s no easy way to feel connected to nature or the lives of others around. That’s why I spend so much time in parks here in Europe while I can. These cities are built for human relationships instead of cars – and you can feel the difference immediately. I am so much more content here with access to public squares than I ever was in the suburbs spending my life bouncing from bubble to isolated bubble. If I could, I would sit in a lively park during a summer golden hour for the rest of my damn life.  </div>
