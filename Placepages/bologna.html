	<div class="journalentry"> Tonight I met an Italian boy named Gianluca. His hair was so poofy and his eyes were so kind. He kind of smelled like that incense store I walk past close to SRISA’s main campus with his big white shirt with rolled-up sleeves. He reminded me a bit of Amanda Hearn. Zero sexual chemistry between us. Was it the height difference? His friend looked like my cousin Billy -- they ran into each other in the piazza where people were sitting around drinking in groups on a Wednesday night. They bought a few beers from the guy peddling them and they both rolled their own cigarettes. I couldn’t understand them and stood there feeling strange. “Cazzo” is a popular word confirmed. I denied an offer for a beer and eventually I went back to my hotel.  </div>
