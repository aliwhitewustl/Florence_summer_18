	<div class="journalentry"> I don’t think I’ll ever forget the moment I saw Trajan’s column for the first time. It was just there, peering through some buildings – an enormous monument I’d studied in many classes before, so much more monumental in person than I was expecting! That’s how everything is in Rome, I learned, just ancient artifacts of incredible significance next to normal-looking apartments and roads. The SCALE of it all was simply astonishing too. It may have been the rosé hitting me but when I first saw the Italian independence building I really felt as if I had been transported to mount Olympus. It doesn’t hurt that I’ve now had three semesters of college-level western art history to recognize and appreciate these icons. I would’ve walked more but my feet finally gave out at around three and passed out immediately upon lying down in our hostel bed.   </div>
