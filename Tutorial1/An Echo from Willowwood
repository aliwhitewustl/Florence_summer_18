			Two gazed into a pool, he gazed and she,
		</p>

		<p>
			  Not hand in hand, yet heart in heart, I think,
		</p>

		<p>
			  Pale and reluctant on the water's brink,
		</p>

		<p>
			As on the brink of parting which must be.
		</p>

		<p>
			Each eyed the other's aspect, she and he,
		</p>

		<p>
			  Each felt one hungering heart leap up and sink,
		</p>

		<p>
			  Each tasted bitterness which both must drink,
		</p>

		<p>
			There on the brink of life's dividing sea.
		</p>
	</div>


Lilies upon the surface, deep below
  Two wistful faces craving each for each,
    Resolute and reluctant without speech:--

A sudden ripple made the faces flow
  One moment joined, to vanish out of reach:
    So those hearts joined, and ah! were parted so.
