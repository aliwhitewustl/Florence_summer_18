	<p>
			Two gazed into a pool, he gazed and she, <br>
			  Not hand in hand, yet heart in heart, I think,<br>
			  Pale and reluctant on the water's brink,<br>
			As on the brink of parting which must be.<br>
	</p>

	<p>
			Each eyed the other's aspect, she and he,<br>
			  Each felt one hungering heart leap up and sink,<br>
			  Each tasted bitterness which both must drink,<br>
			There on the brink of life's dividing sea.
	</p>

	<p>
			Lilies upon the surface, deep below<br>
			  Two wistful faces craving each for each,<br>
			  Resolute and reluctant without speech:--<br>
	</p>

	<p>
			A sudden ripple made the faces flow<br>
			 One moment joined, to vanish out of reach:<br>
			   So those hearts joined, and ah! were parted so.<br>
